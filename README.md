  The IBM Watson [Tone Analyzer][service_url] service is a cognitive linguistic analysis service that detects three types of tones from written text: emotions, social tendencies, and writing style. Emotions identified include things like anger, fear, joy, sadness, and disgust. Identified social tendencies include things from the Big Five personality traits used by some psychologists. These include openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Identified writing styles include confident, analytical, and tentative.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/tone-analyzer-nodejs)

## Getting Started

1. Create a Bluemix Account

  [Sign up][sign_up] in Bluemix, or use an existing account. Watson Beta or Experimental Services are free to use.

2. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry] tool

3. Edit the `manifest.yml` file and change the `<application-name>` to something unique.
  ```none
applications:
- services:
  - tone-analyzer-standard
  name: <application-name>
  command: npm start
  path: .
  memory: 256M
  ```
  The name you use will determinate your application url initially, e.g. `<application-name>.mybluemix.net`.

4. Connect to Bluemix in the command line tool
  For US Region
  ```sh
  $ cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  ```

  For EU Region
  ```sh
  $ cf api https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net
  ```

  ```sh
  $ cf login -u <your user ID>
  ```

5. Create the Tone Analyzer Service in Bluemix

  ```sh
  $ cf create-service tone_analyzer standard tone-analyzer-standard
  ```

6. Push it live!

  ```sh
  $ cf push
  ```

See the full [Getting Started][getting_started] documentation for more details, including code snippets and references.

## Running locally

  The application uses [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

1. Copy the credentials from your `tone-analyzer-standard` service in Bluemix to `app.js`. To see the credentials, use:

    ```sh
    $ cf env <application-name>
    ```
    Example output:
    ```sh
    System-Provided:
    {
    "VCAP_SERVICES": {
      "tone_analyzer": [{
          "credentials": {
            "url": "<url>",
            "password": "<password>",
            "username": "<username>"
          },
        "label": "tone_analyzer",
        "name": "tone-analyzer-standard",
        "plan": "standard"
     }]
    }
    }
    ```

    You need to copy `username`, `password` and `url`.

2. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
3. Go to the project folder in a terminal and run:
    `npm install`
4. Start the application
5.  `npm start`
6. Go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot your Bluemix application, use the logs. To see the logs, run:

  ```sh
  $ cf logs <application-name> --recent
  ```

### Privacy Notice

This node sample web application includes code to track deployments to Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. The following information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker][deploy_track_url] service on each deployment:

* Application Name (`application_name`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application Version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)

This data is collected from the `VCAP_APPLICATION` environment variable in IBM Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Bluemix. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.

### Disabling Deployment Tracking

Deployment tracking can be disabled by removing `require('cf-deployment-tracker-client').track();` from the beginning of the `server.js` file at the root of this repo.
